# Docker
This assignment focuses on the deployment and management of essential network services using Docker containerization technology. Docker enables the creation of lightweight, portable, and isolated containers that ensure consistency and ease of deployment across various environments. The primary objective of this assignment is to demonstrate the implementation of three core network services—DNS, DHCP, and Proxy servers—within Docker containers. The project involves developing individual Docker files for each service, building corresponding Docker images, and deploying them as containers. Specifically, the DNS Server was configured to provide domain name resolution, the DHCP Server to dynamically allocate IP addresses to client systems, and the Proxy Server, implemented using Squid, to control and route web traffic efficiently. Once verified, the custom images were uploaded to Docker Hub for centralized storage and accessibility. The deployment environment was established on the VMware virtualization platform. The server operated on Ubuntu server 22.04 LTS, while the client machine ran on Windows 7. This setup provided a controlled and realistic network environment for testing and validation. The operational status and functionality of all deployed services were confirmed using the docker ps command. Overall, this assignment highlights the practical application of containerization in network service deployment, emphasizing its advantages in scalability, reliability, and simplified management within modern network infrastructures.
